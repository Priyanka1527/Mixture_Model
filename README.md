# Probably Interesting Data
#### Submitted by: Priyanka Saha

EECS 738 Project - The goal of this project is to develop a mixture model for modelling data from 2 different datasets without using any default Machine Learning library.

# Datasets:
- Iris
- Glass Classiciation

# Possible Machine Learning Applications:
- Iris Dataset:
  - Prediction of the class of Iris based on the features
  
- Glass Classification:
  - Prediction of the Glass types using the features
  - Principle component analysis of glass and feature importance
  
# Mixture Model creation Approach:
